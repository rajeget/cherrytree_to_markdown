# cherrytree_to_markdown
Simple program to covert Cherrytree exported html file to markdown. The reason for creating this was because the export from cherrytree to html is clean , but import to html from markdown is not . Used multiple tools like Pandoc but nothing worked. I am finally able to migrate from cherrytree to obsidian markdown . BEST works with obsidian .
